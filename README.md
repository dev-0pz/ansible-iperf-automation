# ansible-iperf-automation
A comprehensive infrastructure automation project that deploys a complete network performance testing environment on OpenStack using Ansible, featuring real-time monitoring with Grafana and persistent metrics storage in MySQL.
üéØ Project Overview
This project automates the deployment and configuration of a network performance testing infrastructure on OpenStack. It creates multiple VMs, configures iPerf3 for network testing, stores results in MySQL, and visualizes performance metrics through Grafana dashboards.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

Automation: Ansible 2.9+ with custom roles and playbooks
Performance Testing: iPerf3 for network throughput testing
Database: MySQL for metrics storage
Monitoring: Grafana with custom JSON dashboards
Security: SSL/TLS encryption, Ansible Vault for secrets
Languages: Python, Ansible/YAML, Bash, SQL, JavaScript

ssh -L 3000:<vm-ip>:3000 -i /home/User/.ssh/<key> ubuntu@<vm-ip>
MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING THE SAME SECURITY GROUP WITH 3306 and 22 so the vms can communicate

sudo snap install grafana
sudo snap services grafana
